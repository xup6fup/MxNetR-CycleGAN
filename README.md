CycleGAN in MxNetR
===

This is a simple example for implementing the CycleGAN by MxNetR. The idea is devoloped by **[this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593)**, and related details can be found in this [project](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/). This is a simple example for MxNetR user, I will use a relatively small dataset for demonstrating how it work.
